### Treasury Rates   
*ustreasuries* is an R-language package which downloads daily Constant-Maturity Treasury (CMT) yields from 1962 to the most-recently completed business day.   

Historical data from 1962 to 2015 was sourced from the Federal Reserve's H15 dataset; data from 2016 onward is pulled in real time from an XML feed provided by the US Treasury Department.

### Derivative Pricing   
Drawing primarily on **Hull, 7th edition** *ustreasuries* includes many options-pricing models, all the greeks and a number of utility functions.

#### Many of the functions have examples drawn from **[Hull, 7th edition](http://raudys.com/kursas/Options,%20Futures%20and%20Other%20Derivatives%207th%20John%20Hull.pdf)** to demonstrate their correctness.

## Installation

We're not on CRAN yet; get the development version from GitHub:

```R
# see https://github.com/hadley/devtools for the
# best procedure to install *devtools* on your
# system; Windows in particular has somewhat
# complicated requirements

devtools::install_github("grfiv/treasuries")

# Notes: 
#    1. Add 'build_vignettes=TRUE' to include vignettes 
#       (recommended, but a current version of pandoc is required)
#    2. add 'auth_token="..."' if you get a 404
#       contact the author for this
#    3. if you receive a message about corrupt databases or fetch(key), 
#       restarting R will fix the problem;
#       these appear to be issues with devtools 1.10.0.9000
```
